**Abstract**â€”Efficient home kitchen management presents a significant challenge in modern households, often leading to food waste, decision fatigue, and suboptimal health and financial outcomes. This paper introduces SmartBite, a novel, AI-driven web application designed to address these challenges by providing an integrated, intelligent kitchen assistant. The system leverages a full-stack architecture built on Next.js and Firebase, with a sophisticated AI backend orchestrated by Genkit. Core functionalities are powered by Google's Gemini and Veo models, enabling advanced features such as optical character recognition (OCR) for receipt scanning, multi-item visual recognition for pantry inventory, and predictive expiry date estimation for fresh produce.

The primary contribution of this work is a suite of interconnected AI agents that deliver a seamless user experience from shopping to consumption. These agents generate personalized recipe recommendations based on available inventory and user preferences, create dynamic meal plans, and provide multimedia-rich cooking guides, including AI-generated step-by-step images, audio narration, and summary videos. Furthermore, SmartBite incorporates AI-powered financial and health coaching by analyzing purchasing patterns to offer actionable insights on spending and nutrition. The system's modular design, utilizing distinct AI flows and tools, demonstrates a scalable approach to building complex, stateful AI applications. The result is a functional prototype that successfully reduces cognitive load for the user, minimizes food waste, and promotes healthier, more sustainable living through intelligent automation. The platform serves as a robust foundation for future research into hyper-personalized nutrition and smart home integration.
