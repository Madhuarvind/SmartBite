The management of a home kitchen in contemporary society presents a significant and multifaceted challenge. Households grapple with fragmented daily routines of meal planning, grocery procurement, inventory management, and cooking, which frequently leads to suboptimal outcomes. A primary consequence is substantial food waste; the United Nations Environment Programme identifies household waste as a major global contributor, representing both a financial drain and an environmental concern. Furthermore, the cognitive burden of deciding what to cook daily, often termed 'decision fatigue,' can result in repetitive, unhealthy meal choices or an over-reliance on costly food delivery services. Compounding these issues are budgetary and health considerations; without integrated tools, tracking grocery expenditures and aligning dietary intake with personal wellness goals becomes exceedingly difficult.

This paper addresses the core inefficiency in traditional kitchen management: the lack of an intelligent, centralized system connecting a household's food inventory with its planning, cooking, and nutritional activities. This technological gap fosters reactive and often wasteful behaviors. The central problem this work confronts is how to leverage advanced artificial intelligence to bridge this gap, transforming a series of disjointed chores into a streamlined, proactive, and intelligent process.

We introduce SmartBite, a novel, AI-driven web application designed as a holistic solution to these challenges. By integrating multimodal AI for automated inventory tracking, generative AI for dynamic recipe and meal plan creation, and analytical AI for health and financial coaching, SmartBite serves as a comprehensive kitchen assistant. This paper presents the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of the SmartBite prototype. We demonstrate how its suite of interconnected AI agents can effectively reduce food waste, alleviate decision fatigue, and empower users to achieve their health and financial goals, thereby providing a robust framework for the future of intelligent home kitchen management.
