The proposed system incorporates the following key features, which are implemented as distinct AI-driven flows:

-   **Automated Inventory Digitization:** Utilizes the Gemini vision model to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on receipts and visual object recognition on groceries, automating data entry.
-   **Predictive Expiry Date Generation:** Employs an AI flow to estimate the shelf life of fresh ingredients, providing crucial data for waste reduction algorithms.
-   **Context-Aware Recipe Generation:** Generates personalized recipes based on real-time inventory, user-specified dietary needs, and ingredients prioritized by their predicted expiry date.
-   **Asynchronous Multimedia Recipe Enhancement:** Enriches recipes by asynchronously generating step-by-step images, audio narration, and summary videos in the background, preventing UI blocking.
-   **AI-Powered Recipe Transformation:** Provides a novel "AI Taste Predictor" tool that re-engineers entire recipes based on natural language requests (e.g., "make this spicier," "convert to vegan").
-   **Integrated Financial & Health Coaching:** Implements AI flows that analyze purchase history from scanned receipts to generate charts and actionable advice on spending and nutrition.
-   **Real-time Collaborative Shopping Assistance:** Utilizes a Genkit tool to check family inventory in real-time via a "Smart Lens" or chat interface, preventing duplicate purchases.

These features work in concert to provide a comprehensive and intelligent kitchen management solution that addresses the core limitations of existing systems.
