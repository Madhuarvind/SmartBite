The management of a home kitchen in contemporary society presents a significant and multifaceted challenge. Households grapple with fragmented daily routines of meal planning, grocery procurement, inventory management, and cooking, which frequently leads to suboptimal outcomes, including substantial food waste, financial inefficiency, and poor nutritional choices.

While a plethora of digital applications exist for recipe discovery, meal planning, and nutrition tracking, they overwhelmingly operate in isolated silos. This creates a critical technology gap: the lack of an intelligent, centralized system that dynamically connects a household's real-time food inventory with its planning, cooking, and health-related activities. Existing solutions either rely on tedious and error-prone manual data entry for inventory tracking or offer suggestions that are not actionable based on on-hand ingredients, failing to address the primary user need of utilizing what is available.

This fundamental disconnect between inventory awareness and culinary guidance is a direct contributor to food waste and decision fatigue. The core problem this work confronts is the absence of a proactive, automated framework that can bridge this gap.

Therefore, this research addresses the challenge of designing and implementing an integrated AI-driven system that provides a holistic solution for intelligent home kitchen management. The objective is to leverage multimodal AI to automate inventory tracking and generate personalized, context-aware culinary guidance, thereby transforming a series of disjointed chores into a streamlined, efficient, and intelligent process.
