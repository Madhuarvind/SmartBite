To address the critical gaps in current home kitchen management, this paper proposes **SmartBite**, a novel, AI-driven web application designed to serve as a holistic, intelligent kitchen assistant. The system integrates real-time inventory awareness with generative AI capabilities to provide a seamless workflow from meal planning and grocery shopping to cooking and nutritional analysis.

### System Architecture

The SmartBite system is implemented using a modern, full-stack architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the user interface and the backend AI logic. The architecture consists of three primary layers, as illustrated in the workflow diagram below.

Create a clean, modern, technical system architecture diagram for an IEEE conference paper. The diagram should illustrate the workflow of an AI application called "SmartBite". Use a formal, minimalist style with clear labels and directed arrows. The diagram must have three distinct vertical lanes or columns, each with a clear heading.

**Column 1: "Client-Side (Browser)"**
*   This column should contain one primary box labeled: **"Next.js Frontend - React Components"**.
*   This box represents the user interface. Use a vibrant yellow-gold color for this box, with dark text.

**Column 2: "Server-Side (Next.js & Genkit)"**
*   This column represents the application's backend logic. It should be the central column.
*   Inside this column, create a large container to hold several components.
*   Within this container, add three distinct sub-boxes arranged vertically:
    1.  Top box: **"Genkit AI Flows (e.g., recommendRecipes, scanReceipt)"**
    2.  Middle box: **"Genkit Tools (e.g., checkInventory)"**
    3.  Bottom box: **"Firebase SDK"**
*   Use a bright, peachy-coral orange color for these server-side boxes, with dark text.

**Column 3: "External Services"**
*   This column represents the third-party cloud services.
*   It should contain two boxes, stacked vertically:
    1.  Top box: **"Firebase (Auth, Firestore)"**. Color this box green, with white text.
    2.  Bottom box: **"Google AI (Gemini & Veo Models)"**. Color this box blue, with white text.

**Connections (Arrows):**
Draw clear, labeled, directed arrows to show the data flow between the boxes.
1.  From **"Next.js Frontend"** to **"Genkit AI Flows"**, label the arrow: **"Server Action Call"**.
2.  From **"Genkit AI Flows"** to **"Genkit Tools"**, label the arrow: **"Uses Tool"**.
3.  From **"Genkit Tools"** to **"Firebase SDK"**, label the arrow: **"Queries/Mutates Data"**.
4.  From **"Firebase SDK"** to the **"Firebase"** box in the third column, label the arrow: **"Interacts with"**.
5.  From **"Genkit AI Flows"** to the **"Google AI"** box in the third column, label the arrow: **"Calls Generative Model"**.
6.  Draw a final arrow directly from the **"Firebase"** box in the third column back to the **"Next.js Frontend"** in the first column. Label this arrow: **"Reads Data via Firebase SDK"**.
```

1.  **Client-Side Layer:** The user interface is a responsive web application built with Next.js and React. It utilizes ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible design. This layer is responsible for capturing user inputs (e.g., camera scans, text queries) and displaying the outputs generated by the AI backend.

2.  **Server-Side Layer:** The backend logic is managed within a Next.js server environment. The core of this layer is **Genkit**, an open-source AI orchestration framework from Google. Genkit is used to define and manage all AI-powered operations through structured **Flows** (e.g., `recommendRecipes`, `scanReceipt`) and **Tools**. Tools, such as `checkInventory`, provide a secure and reliable interface for the AI flows to interact with the database, giving the AI the ability to query real-time data to inform its generative outputs.

3.  **External Services Layer:** The system relies on two key external services. **Firebase** provides the backend infrastructure, including Firestore for the NoSQL database and Firebase Authentication for secure user management. **Google AI** provides the generative models, primarily the Gemini family of models for complex reasoning, text generation, and vision analysis, and the Veo model for video generation.

### Key Innovations

The primary innovation of the proposed system is the tight integration of multimodal AI with real-time inventory data. Unlike existing applications that rely on manual input or operate without inventory context, SmartBite uses vision AI to automate data entry and generative AI to create context-aware, personalized culinary guidance. The use of Genkit to orchestrate complex chains of AI calls—such as identifying an ingredient, checking inventory, and suggesting a recipe—represents a novel approach to building stateful, intelligent agents for home management.

### Expected Outcomes

The proposed system is expected to significantly reduce food waste by prioritizing expiring ingredients in recipe recommendations. It will alleviate user decision fatigue by providing proactive, personalized meal suggestions. Furthermore, by analyzing purchase history, the system will offer users actionable insights into their spending and nutritional habits, promoting healthier and more financially sustainable lifestyles.
