To address the critical gaps in current home kitchen management, this paper proposes **SmartBite**, a novel, AI-driven web application designed to serve as a holistic, intelligent kitchen assistant. The system integrates real-time inventory awareness with generative AI capabilities to provide a seamless workflow from meal planning and grocery shopping to cooking and nutritional analysis.

### A. System Architecture

The SmartBite system is implemented using a modern, full-stack architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the user interface and the backend AI logic. The architecture consists of three primary layers, as illustrated in the workflow diagram below.

Create a clean, modern, technical system architecture diagram for an IEEE conference paper. The diagram should illustrate the workflow of an AI application called "SmartBite". Use a formal, minimalist style with clear labels and directed arrows. The diagram must have three distinct vertical lanes or columns, each with a clear heading.

**Column 1: "Client-Side (Browser)"**
*   This column should contain one primary box labeled: **"Next.js Frontend - React Components"**.
*   This box represents the user interface. Use a vibrant yellow-gold color for this box, with dark text.

**Column 2: "Server-Side (Next.js & Genkit)"**
*   This column represents the application's backend logic. It should be the central column.
*   Inside this column, create a large container to hold several components.
*   Within this container, add three distinct sub-boxes arranged vertically:
    1.  Top box: **"Genkit AI Flows (e.g., recommendRecipes, scanReceipt)"**
    2.  Middle box: **"Genkit Tools (e.g., checkInventory)"**
    3.  Bottom box: **"Firebase SDK"**
*   Use a bright, peachy-coral orange color for these server-side boxes, with dark text.

**Column 3: "External Services"**
*   This column represents the third-party cloud services.
*   It should contain two boxes, stacked vertically:
    1.  Top box: **"Firebase (Auth, Firestore)"**. Color this box green, with white text.
    2.  Bottom box: **"Google AI (Gemini & Veo Models)"**. Color this box blue, with white text.

**Connections (Arrows):**
Draw clear, labeled, directed arrows to show the data flow between the boxes.
1.  From **"Next.js Frontend"** to **"Genkit AI Flows"**, label the arrow: **"Server Action Call"**.
2.  From **"Genkit AI Flows"** to **"Genkit Tools"**, label the arrow: **"Uses Tool"**.
3.  From **"Genkit Tools"** to **"Firebase SDK"**, label the arrow: **"Queries/Mutates Data"**.
4.  From **"Firebase SDK"** to the **"Firebase"** box in the third column, label the arrow: **"Interacts with"**.
5.  From **"Genkit AI Flows"** to the **"Google AI"** box in the third column, label the arrow: **"Calls Generative Model"**.
6.  Draw a final arrow directly from the **"Firebase"** box in the third column back to the **"Next.js Frontend"** in the first column. Label this arrow: **"Reads Data via Firebase SDK"**.
```

The client-side layer is a responsive web application built with Next.js and React, utilizing ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible design. This layer captures user inputs such as camera scans and text queries and displays outputs generated by the AI backend. The server-side layer is managed within a Next.js server environment, with Genkit serving as the core AI orchestration framework. Genkit defines and manages AI-powered operations through structured Flows and Tools, providing a secure interface for querying real-time data to inform generative outputs. The external services layer relies on Firebase for backend infrastructure and Google AI for generative models.

### B. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

SmartBite employs multiple methods for data acquisition to ensure comprehensive inventory tracking. Users can capture images of groceries, pantry items, or receipts using device cameras, supporting both photo uploads and real-time scanning. Barcode scanning is integrated for quick product identification and automatic data population from product databases. Manual text-based entry is also supported for items without visual identifiers. Preprocessing includes image resizing, normalization, and enhancement to optimize AI model input, optical character recognition for extracting text data from receipts, data cleaning to validate and remove duplicates, and feature extraction through vision models to identify ingredients, estimate quantities, and predict expiry dates.

### C. AI/ML Models Used

SmartBite leverages multiple AI and ML models across different functional areas. Image recognition utilizes convolutional neural networks based on ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures for detecting and classifying food ingredients, with the Gemini Vision model providing advanced multimodal understanding. Recipe recommendation employs generative AI models using transformer-based architectures for natural language generation, fine-tuned to create context-aware recipes. Nutrition analysis uses knowledge graph-based systems integrated with external nutritional databases, with machine learning models predicting nutritional values. Expiry prediction relies on time-series analysis and regression models trained on historical food spoilage data. Natural language processing models enable understanding of user queries and preferences for conversational interactions.

### D. Workflow of the System

The SmartBite workflow follows a streamlined user-centric process. Users begin by scanning or manually entering their current pantry and fridge contents via the mobile or web interface. The system processes this input through AI models to identify ingredients, quantities, and expiry information. Based on available inventory and user preferences such as dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences, personalized recipe suggestions are generated. For selected recipes, step-by-step images, audio instructions, and video demonstrations are generated asynchronously. Each recipe is analyzed for nutritional content, providing detailed breakdowns and health insights. The system identifies missing ingredients and generates optimized shopping lists with price comparisons. User interactions and recipe outcomes are tracked to improve future recommendations through continuous learning.

### E. Integration of Modules

SmartBite's modular architecture ensures seamless integration between components. Next.js server actions provide secure communication between the React frontend and backend services, enabling real-time data synchronization. Genkit serves as the central orchestration layer, managing data flow between AI models, tools, and external services. Firebase SDK offers a unified interface for data operations across inventory management, user profiles, and recipe storage. RESTful APIs connect the system with nutritional databases, price comparison services, and barcode lookup systems. Background job queues handle computationally intensive tasks like video generation, ensuring responsive user interactions.

### F. User Interface Design

The SmartBite interface is designed for intuitive, mobile-first interaction. The dashboard serves as a central hub displaying current inventory status, expiring item alerts, and personalized recipe suggestions. The scanning interface provides camera-based scanning with real-time feedback and guided instructions for optimal image capture. The recipe viewer offers interactive recipe displays with multimedia support, nutritional information, and shopping list generation. An analytics dashboard visualizes spending patterns, nutritional intake, and waste reduction metrics. Settings and preferences allow user profile management including dietary restrictions, allergy information, and notification preferences. The system is implemented as a progressive web app, installable on mobile devices with offline capabilities for core inventory tracking.

### G. Advantages Over Existing Systems

The primary innovation of the proposed system is the tight integration of multimodal AI with real-time inventory data. Unlike existing applications that rely on manual input or operate without inventory context, SmartBite uses vision AI to automate data entry and generative AI to create context-aware, personalized culinary guidance. The use of Genkit to orchestrate complex chains of AI calls represents a novel approach to building stateful, intelligent agents for home management. The proposed system is expected to significantly reduce food waste by prioritizing expiring ingredients in recipe recommendations. It will alleviate user decision fatigue by providing proactive, personalized meal suggestions. Furthermore, by analyzing purchase history, the system will offer users actionable insights into their spending and nutritional habits, promoting healthier and more financially sustainable lifestyles.
