To address the critical gaps in current home kitchen management, this paper proposes **SmartBite**, a novel, AI-driven web application designed to serve as a holistic, intelligent kitchen assistant. The system integrates real-time inventory awareness with generative AI capabilities to provide a seamless workflow from meal planning and grocery shopping to cooking and nutritional analysis.

### System Architecture

The SmartBite system is implemented using a modern, full-stack architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the user interface and the backend AI logic. The architecture consists of three primary layers, as illustrated in the workflow diagram below.

    end

```

1.  **Client-Side Layer:** The user interface is a responsive web application built with Next.js and React. It utilizes ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible design. This layer is responsible for capturing user inputs (e.g., camera scans, text queries) and displaying the outputs generated by the AI backend.

2.  **Server-Side Layer:** The backend logic is managed within a Next.js server environment. The core of this layer is **Genkit**, an open-source AI orchestration framework from Google. Genkit is used to define and manage all AI-powered operations through structured **Flows** (e.g., `recommendRecipes`, `scanReceipt`) and **Tools**. Tools, such as `checkInventory`, provide a secure and reliable interface for the AI flows to interact with the database, giving the AI the ability to query real-time data to inform its generative outputs.

3.  **External Services Layer:** The system relies on two key external services. **Firebase** provides the backend infrastructure, including Firestore for the NoSQL database and Firebase Authentication for secure user management. **Google AI** provides the generative models, primarily the Gemini family of models for complex reasoning, text generation, and vision analysis, and the Veo model for video generation.

### Key Innovations

The primary innovation of the proposed system is the tight integration of multimodal AI with real-time inventory data. Unlike existing applications that rely on manual input or operate without inventory context, SmartBite uses vision AI to automate data entry and generative AI to create context-aware, personalized culinary guidance. The use of Genkit to orchestrate complex chains of AI calls—such as identifying an ingredient, checking inventory, and suggesting a recipe—represents a novel approach to building stateful, intelligent agents for home management.

### Expected Outcomes

The proposed system is expected to significantly reduce food waste by prioritizing expiring ingredients in recipe recommendations. It will alleviate user decision fatigue by providing proactive, personalized meal suggestions. Furthermore, by analyzing purchase history, the system will offer users actionable insights into their spending and nutritional habits, promoting healthier and more financially sustainable lifestyles.
