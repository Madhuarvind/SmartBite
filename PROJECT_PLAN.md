### **Week I: Project Formation and Problem Orientation**

-   **Activity:** Formation of Project Group and Orientation on Problem Statement Preparation.
    -   Finalize project team roles and responsibilities.
    -   Conduct brainstorming sessions to understand the core problems in modern kitchen management: food waste, decision fatigue, and health/budget tracking.
    -   Initial review of the "SmartBite" concept and its potential to solve these problems.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Domain Knowledge**.
    -   A shared document will be created summarizing the problem space, target audience, and the overall vision for the SmartBite application. This forms the foundation of our domain knowledge.

### **Week II: Feasibility and Literature Survey**

    -   Conduct a technical feasibility study on the core technologies: Next.js, Firebase, and Google's Generative AI (Gemini and Veo).
    -   Perform a literature review of existing academic papers on food recognition, recipe generation, and smart fridge systems (referencing `ALGORITHMS.md`).
    -   Analyze existing market solutions (SuperCook, Mealime, MyFitnessPal) to identify gaps and opportunities.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Problem Statement**.
    -   A refined, formal problem statement will be drafted, clearly articulating the inefficiency in home kitchen management that SmartBite will address.

### **Week III: Requirements and Planning**

-   **Activity:** Requirements, Timeline, Resources, Cost (If applicable) analysis.
    -   Define functional requirements (e.g., AI Bill Scanner, Recipe Recommendation, AI Taste Predictor) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, usability).
    -   Detail the project timeline as outlined in this document.
    -   Identify necessary resources: Firebase project, Google AI API keys, and development environment setup.
    -   Analyze potential costs related to API usage and Firebase services.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Project Plan**.
    -   This document will serve as the formal project plan.

### **Week IV: Conceptual Design**

-   **Activity:** Conceptual Design.
    -   Design the three-tier system architecture: Client-Side (Next.js), Server-Side (Genkit AI Flows), and External Services (Firebase, Google AI).
    -   Create UI/UX wireframes for key screens: Dashboard, Inventory, Recipe Finder, Plate Scanner.
    -   Define the data models for Firestore (e.g., `users`, `inventory`, `recipeHistory`, `activity`).
    -   Design the structure for Genkit AI flows and tools.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Design, Diagrams if any**.
    -   System architecture diagrams (like the one in `ALGORITHMS.md`).
    -   UI wireframes and mockups.
    -   Database schema design.

### **Week V: Assessment and Review 1**

-   **Activity:** Assessment and Performance Evaluation - Conceptual Design.
    -   Internal review of the conceptual design documents.
    -   Present the project plan, problem statement, and conceptual design for the first formal review.
    -   Conduct a quiz or knowledge check within the team to ensure alignment on the project's foundation.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   **Quiz:** Internal team quiz on system architecture and user flows.
    -   **Review 1:** Formal presentation and review of all documentation and designs produced to date.

### **Weeks VI-VIII: Initial Implementation (Coding)**

-   **Activity:** Implementation - Coding / Fabrication.
    -   Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI.
    -   Initialize the Firebase project and configure Firebase Auth and Firestore.
    -   Implement the basic UI layout, including navigation and page structure (`(app)` and `(auth)` routes).
    -   Develop and test the user authentication flow (Login/Register).
    -   Begin implementation of the `Inventory` page, including manual item entry and display.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Weekly Progress Updates**.
    -   Submit weekly reports summarizing tasks completed, challenges encountered, and plans for the next week.

### **Week IX: Mid-point Performance Evaluation**

-   **Activity:** Performance Evaluation - Initial Implementation.
    -   Test the implemented features: user registration, login, manual inventory management.
    -   Demonstrate the initial, functional prototype.
    -   Present the progress to the project supervisor for the second formal review.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Review 2**.
    -   A live demonstration of the application's progress and a Q&A session.

### **Weeks X-XII: Core Implementation and Testing**

-   **Activity:** Core Implementation and Testing.
    -   Implement the core AI features as Genkit flows: `scanReceipt`, `recommendRecipes`, `analyzePlate`.
    -   Develop the Genkit tool (`checkInventoryTool`) to allow AI flows to interact with Firestore.
    -   Integrate the AI flows with the frontend using Next.js Server Actions.
    -   Build out the UI for the Bill Scanner, Plate Scanner, and Recipe pages.
    -   Develop a suite of test cases for the core functionalities.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   **Draft Report:** Begin writing the main sections of the final project report (`PROJECT_REPORT.md`).
    -   **Test cases if any:** A document detailing the test cases for both UI interactions and AI flow inputs/outputs.

### **Week XIII: Validation**

-   **Activity:** Validation.
    -   Conduct end-to-end testing of the core user journeys (e.g., scanning a receipt -> items appearing in inventory -> getting a recipe recommendation).
    -   Refine AI prompts and schemas based on testing results to improve accuracy and reliability.
    -   Validate the system against the requirements defined in Week III.
    -   Finalize the text content for the project report and prepare the final presentation.
-   **Key Deliverable:** **Final Report + PPT**.
