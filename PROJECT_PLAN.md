# Detailed Project Execution Plan: SmartBite AI Kitchen Assistant

This document provides a comprehensive, week-by-week breakdown of the 15-week execution plan for the SmartBite project. Each section details the specific activities, technical tasks, and key deliverables required to successfully develop and deploy the AI-powered smart kitchen assistant.

---

### **Week I: Project Formation and Problem Orientation**

-   **Primary Activity:** Formation of Project Group and Comprehensive Orientation on Problem Statement Preparation.
    -   **Task 1: Team & Role Finalization.** Officially assign and document team roles (e.g., Project Lead, Frontend Developer, AI/Backend Developer, UI/UX Designer). Establish communication channels (e.g., Slack, Discord) and meeting schedules (e.g., daily stand-ups, weekly reviews).
    -   **Task 2: In-Depth Problem Brainstorming.** Conduct structured brainstorming sessions focused on the core challenges of modern kitchen management. Use mind-mapping techniques to explore sub-problems related to:
        -   **Food Waste:** What are the primary causes? (e.g., forgotten items, poor planning, spoilage).
        -   **Decision Fatigue:** What cognitive load is involved in daily meal decisions?
        -   **Health & Budget Management:** Why is it difficult for users to track nutritional intake and grocery spending?
    -   **Task 3: Vision & Scope Definition.** Hold a vision-setting workshop to align the team on the "North Star" for SmartBite. Define the high-level scope of the project, establishing what is "in" and what is "out" for the initial prototype. Document the core value proposition for the target user.

-   **Key Deliverable:** **Domain Knowledge & Project Charter Document**.
    -   Create a formal "Project Charter" document (`PROJECT_CHARTER.md`). This document will be the single source of truth for the project's foundation and will contain:
        -   A detailed summary of the problem space, including statistics on food waste and consumer habits.
        -   A "Target Audience Persona" describing the ideal user (e.g., busy professional, health-conscious family).
        -   The high-level vision and mission statement for the SmartBite application.
        -   A list of initial project goals and success criteria.

### **Week II: Feasibility and Literature Survey**

-   **Primary Activity:** Technical Feasibility Study & Comprehensive Literature/Industry Survey.
    -   **Task 1: Technical Feasibility Analysis.**
        -   **Next.js & Genkit:** Evaluate the integration capabilities. How do Server Actions communicate with Genkit flows? Investigate potential performance bottlenecks.
        -   **Firebase:** Confirm Firestore's NoSQL data modeling is suitable for the app's data structures. Evaluate Firebase Auth providers (Email/Pass, Google) and security implications.
        -   **Google Generative AI:** Research the specific capabilities and limitations of the Gemini (for text/vision) and Veo (for video) models. Investigate API rate limits, costs, and response times for different tasks (e.g., OCR vs. image generation).
    -   **Task 2: Academic Literature Review.** Systematically review the papers listed in `ALGORITHMS.md`. For each key paper, create a one-paragraph summary detailing its methodology and relevance to SmartBite. Categorize findings to inform the system's design.
    -   **Task 3: Competitive Market Analysis.** Create a feature-comparison matrix for competitors like SuperCook, Mealime, and MyFitnessPal. Analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and, most importantly, identify the "market gap" that SmartBite will fill (i.e., the fully integrated, AI-driven feedback loop).

-   **Key Deliverable:** **Refined Problem Statement & Feasibility Report**.
    -   Update `PROJECT_REPORT.md` with a formal, refined **Problem Statement** that is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    -   Create a `FEASIBILITY_REPORT.md` document containing the findings from the technical analysis and competitive review, concluding with a "go/no-go" recommendation for the chosen tech stack.

### **Week III: Requirements and Detailed Planning**

-   **Primary Activity:** Requirements Elicitation, Timeline Finalization, and Resource Analysis.
    -   **Task 1: Functional Requirements Definition.** Detail every user-facing feature as a user story. Examples:
        -   "As a user, I want to take a photo of my receipt so that the items are automatically added to my digital inventory."
        -   "As a user, I want to receive recipe suggestions based on ingredients that are about to expire."
    -   **Task 2: Non-Functional Requirements Definition.** Document critical system attributes:
        -   **Performance:** AI responses for text should be < 5s; image analysis < 10s.
        -   **Security:** All user data must be protected by Firestore Security Rules.
        -   **Usability:** The app must be responsive and intuitive on both mobile and desktop browsers.
    -   **Task 3: Resource & Cost Planning.**
        -   Set up the Firebase project and enable required services (Auth, Firestore).
        -   Obtain and securely store Google AI API keys.
        -   Estimate potential API costs based on projected usage for the development phase.

-   **Key Deliverable:** **Finalized Project Plan**.
    -   This `PROJECT_PLAN.md` document, in its detailed form, will be formally approved. It will serve as the master guide for the project's execution and will be version-controlled.

### **Week IV: Conceptual Design & System Architecture**

-   **Primary Activity:** Conceptual Design of System Architecture, UI/UX, and Data Models.
    -   **Task 1: System Architecture Design.** Create detailed diagrams illustrating the three-tier architecture. Show the specific flow of data for a key user journey, like `scanReceipt`:
        1.  Client (React Component) -> Next.js Server Action.
        2.  Server Action -> `scanReceipt` Genkit Flow.
        3.  `scanReceipt` Flow -> Google Gemini Vision Model.
        4.  Gemini Response -> Flow processes data.
        5.  Flow -> `predictExpiryDate` Flow.
        6.  Flow returns structured JSON to Client.
    -   **Task 2: UI/UX Wireframing & Mockups.** Use a tool like Figma or draw.io to create low-fidelity wireframes for all primary screens (Dashboard, Inventory, Bill Scanner, Plate Scanner, Recipe Finder, Meal Planner). Progress to high-fidelity mockups for the Dashboard and Inventory screens, establishing the visual style (colors, fonts, spacing).
    -   **Task
3: Firestore Data Modeling.** Define the schemas for each Firestore collection in `backend.json`. For example:
        -   `users/{userId}`
        -   `users/{userId}/inventory/{itemId}`
        -   `users/{userId}/recipeHistory/{historyId}`
        -   `users/{userId}/activity/{activityId}`
    -   **Task 4: Genkit Flow & Tool Design.** For each AI feature, define the input (Zod schema), output (Zod schema), and the high-level prompt. Design the `checkInventoryTool`'s interface, specifying what it needs and what it returns.

-   **Key Deliverable:** **Comprehensive Design Document**.
    -   A `DESIGN.md` file will be created, containing:
        -   The detailed system architecture diagrams.
        -   Embedded images of the UI wireframes and mockups.
        -   The complete Firestore database schema.
        -   The API design for all Genkit flows and tools.

### **Week V: Assessment and Formal Review 1**

-   **Primary Activity:** Assessment and Performance Evaluation of the Conceptual Design.
    -   **Task 1: Internal Design Review.** The entire team will conduct a peer review of the `DESIGN.md` document. The goal is to identify potential flaws, inconsistencies, or risks in the proposed architecture and user flows before implementation begins.
    -   **Task 2: Formal Presentation Preparation.** Create a slide deck (e.g., using Google Slides or PowerPoint) summarizing the project's progress to date. The presentation should cover the Problem Statement, Project Plan, and a walkthrough of the Conceptual Design.
    -   **Task 3: Team Knowledge Check.** Conduct an internal quiz covering the system architecture, key user flows, and the chosen tech stack. This ensures every team member is fully aligned and understands the plan.

-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   **Internal Quiz Results:** A record of the team's quiz scores to confirm readiness for implementation.
    -   **Review 1 Presentation:** The formal slide deck presented for evaluation. A successful review is the gate to begin the implementation phase.
