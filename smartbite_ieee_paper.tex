\section{Introduction}
The global food system faces significant challenges, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption being lost or wasted annually \cite{gustavsson2011global}. This amounts to nearly 1.3 billion tons of food waste, representing enormous economic, environmental, and social costs. Concurrently, many households struggle with meal planning, grocery management, and nutritional awareness.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing, have created new opportunities for addressing these challenges. Systems like those described in \cite{salvador2019inverse} and \cite{marin2021recipe1m} have demonstrated the potential of AI in food recognition and recipe generation. However, most existing solutions focus on isolated aspects rather than providing comprehensive kitchen management.

SmartBite addresses this gap by integrating multiple AI capabilities into a unified platform that serves as a personal chef, nutritionist, and financial advisor. The system combines real-time inventory tracking, intelligent recipe suggestions, waste prediction, and sustainability analytics to create a holistic solution for modern kitchen management.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Food Recognition Systems}
Several studies have explored food recognition using computer vision techniques. Kawano and Yanai \cite{kawano2014food} pioneered food image recognition using deep convolutional features. Subsequent work by Min et al. \cite{min2017you} explored rich recipe information for cross-region food analysis. More recently, Salvador et al. \cite{salvador2019inverse} developed inverse cooking systems that generate recipes from food images.

\subsection{Smart Refrigerator Technologies}
The concept of smart refrigerators has been extensively studied. Bie\'n et al. \cite{bien2020recipenlg} created datasets for semi-structured text generation in cooking contexts. Various IoT-based approaches \cite{bouzembrak2019internet} have been proposed for food safety and quality monitoring in refrigerators.

\subsection{Recipe Recommendation Systems}
Recipe recommendation has evolved from simple ingredient matching to sophisticated AI systems. Chen and Ngo \cite{chen2016deep} developed deep-based ingredient recognition for cooking recipe retrieval. Wang et al. \cite{wang2021market2dish} proposed health-aware food recommendation systems that consider nutritional requirements.

\subsection{Food Waste Reduction}
Food waste reduction has been a significant focus area. Studies by \cite{gustavsson2011global} have quantified global food losses, while technical solutions for waste reduction in refrigerators have been explored in various IEEE publications \cite{ieee9792896}.

\section{System Architecture}

The SmartBite system follows a modern web architecture with clear separation between client-side and server-side components, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:architecture}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{architecture_diagram.png}
\caption{SmartBite System Architecture}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The architecture consists of four main layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Client Layer}: Next.js frontend with React components and Firebase SDK
    \item \textbf{Server Layer}: Next.js runtime with Genkit AI orchestration
    \item \textbf{AI Processing Layer}: Google Gemini models for vision and NLP
    \item \textbf{Data Layer}: Firebase services including Firestore and Authentication
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{AI Flows and Processing}
The system implements numerous AI flows for different functionalities:

\subsubsection{Computer Vision Processing}
Food recognition follows the YOLO-based approach described in \cite{ieee9526989}, with confidence scores calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Confidence} = \text{Pr(Object)} \times \text{IOU}_{\text{pred, truth}}
\end{equation}

where $\text{Pr(Object)}$ represents the probability that an object exists in the bounding box and $\text{IOU}_{\text{pred, truth}}$ is the Intersection over Union between predicted and ground truth boxes.

\subsubsection{Nutritional Analysis}
Nutritional content estimation follows the formula:

\begin{equation}
\text{Calories} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{weight}_i \times \text{calorie\_density}_i)
\end{equation}

where $n$ represents the number of ingredients, $\text{weight}_i$ is the estimated weight of ingredient $i$, and $\text{calorie\_density}_i$ is the caloric density per unit weight.

\subsubsection{Recipe Recommendation}
The recommendation algorithm uses ingredient compatibility scoring:

\begin{equation}
\text{Score}(i,j) = \frac{\text{frequency}(i,j)}{\sqrt{\text{frequency}(i) \times \text{frequency}(j)}}
\end{equation}

where $\text{frequency}(i,j)$ represents the co-occurrence frequency of ingredients $i$ and $j$ in recipes.

\subsection{Data Management}
The system employs Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization, implementing a comprehensive data model designed to support all application functionalities. The data architecture comprises four primary collections: Users Collection for storing user profiles and preferences, Inventory Collection for real-time tracking of food items and their status, Recipes Collection containing an extensive database of culinary recipes with detailed nutritional information, and Activity Collection that records user cooking history and consumption patterns. This structured approach ensures efficient data retrieval and seamless synchronization across all platform components.
